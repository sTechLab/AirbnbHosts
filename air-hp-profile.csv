I am a well travelled guy who has been all over the world. I am a true budget traveller and that is why I set up this profile and my condo to answer to the needs of the traveller who share the same values as I do. I enjoy meeting and hosting travelers from all walks of life and every corner of the globe.

I always keep my place clean. After hosting and being hosted in different places by different people, I realized that not everybody has the same manners or understanding. Or not everybody was thought basic manners at home when they were young. 

The whole purpose of setting this profile was *to help* people and give back a little to return the good karma that was given to me by others. I know I am helping to people and *giving them a deal*, so remember that if you appreciate my hospitality you can always come back. My intent is to create a pool of regular guests and future friendships based on this.

I am a very caring and considerate host; also I am a very busy person and my life does not shape around Airbnb and I do this as a hobby. If I decline your request without prodviding a reason it means I am either travelling for work or using the place for other purposes. Do not seek other meanings behind that.

I've also been a Lyft driver and mentor for the last year or so, driving around town sharing stories and meeting new people.

I have two friendly laboradors (Bailey and Baxter) and Kathy has a timid cat (Elphie).

We are typically up early for work, as are the dogs. We certainly try to keep noise to a minimum but light sleepers should be warned. My children also visit every Wednesday during the day (after 9am). They're little so we're still working on being quiet when people are sleeping. If you know you need a late sleep let us know and we can come back to the house a little later in the morning. 

I hope you'll enjoy your stay in my awesome Buena Park apartment! The neighborhood is great with just about anything you need close by. If you need help with anything during your stay please do not hesitate to ask.

I have always been interested in showing hospitality to others.

As I am getting older I have decided that I really want to travel and see more of the world...but limited finances (coupled with my refusal to sit int he back of planes) as well as a desire to really get to see how people live and just not how tourists are treated makes this a great option for me!

I enjoy walking to nearby Fort Greene Park or all the way to Lower Manhattan via the Brooklyn Bridge, and attending free concerts/festivals in NYC's beautiful parks during the summer.

If you ever rented a private RV in San Diego you probably rented it from us, or at least ran across our business.

But before you ask, and start planning an RV road trip to San Diego we sold the RV business, moved to WA, used our prior experience from that business and now have rental properties in Seattle and Sammamish. 

The Sammamish lake view property is located on the ""East Side,"" an area that is known for being more of a suburban family area, and the Seattle property is on the ""West Side"" in a suburb next to downtown Seattle, which is known for its artsy laid back and eclectic vibe.

I bring warmth to those around me and extend myself when others need a hand. I believe attracting positive things to my life is a result of sharing my positive energy with others.

I've been dedicated to my career in public health - psychology. My early affinity for helping others, as my mom says, developed when I was very young.  The large family that I hail from weren't much help in deterring me away from a career in helping others either.

Since eligible to work at the age of 16, I've held some type of job in public health that I fostered into a career with the help of a BA, then MA in Psychology.  My more recent venture is a return to school for a Ph.D. Between work, school, volunteering and trying to maintain some semblance of a social life, I have a rich schedule that keeps me on my toes.

I've done a bit of traveling in my life. At an early age, family vacations took me to Canada and Mexico and in more recent years personal and business brought me to Paris, Malaysia, Holland, Singapore, Bulgaria, United Kingdom, Mexico, Germany, Peru, Hungary, Japan and Italy. Domestically, I've been to all of the West Coast States, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Utah, New York, and Florida to spout off a few. :-)

I look forward to meeting many folks through this service, perhaps one of those people will be you.

15018669,"If it's not obvious, I'm a designer - an ex-architect who after twenty years sold my eight-person branding and graphic design studio here in NO in order to go out on my own and re-focus my work. In May of 2014 I was lucky enough to be able to buy the guest house across the street from mine from my wonderful neighbors, do a little renovation, and share it with the world. I work from home most of the time (unless I'm at The Orange Couch, my favorite coffee shop not far away) so I'm often around. 

I'm generally a vegetarian, but lately I've fallen off the wagon for seafood - we'll see about that. I love riding my bike in the Quarter. My teenage son is 6'4"" and counting (and that doesn't come from me). I'm pretty handy with tools and gadgets. I'm kind of a closet sci-fi fan. My favorite thing about this city is where the old meets the new. I have a background in classical music, having played the 'cello in my youth (fell off that wagon too, sadly), but some day want to play new music. I love the IDEA of books, but read too slowly to make it happen much. I love traveling, but these days I don't get to enough (I'm looking forward to living a little vicariously through you). I love dashes (and parenthetical comments). It will seem odd once you meet me, but I grew up in Dallas, Texas (and I still miss good Tex-Mex). 

I came here to Tulane in 1984, during the World's Fair - and I never left (except for an almost year-long stint in Austin after Katrina). In contrast to all the other eighteen-year-olds in my midst, I didn't really like New Orleans at first - I felt like the place was dirty, nothing worked, the people weren't so bright. Then, at some magic moment I GOT it - the place is not dirty - it's well-worn with a patina that reflects that it is REAL and loved and storied. Everything works that we NEED to have working, and we don't fret too much about the rest. And as for the people - well, in fact, they understand things that apparently no one any place else seems to understand. They have their priorities straight, and then some. My college friends are still flummoxed - and super-jealous.

When my son and I moved to Bywater from Uptown in 2007, I was probably a little conspicuously polished for the neighborhood, but as the area has gotten fancier since then, I no longer stand out so much. I love the neighborhood as it is today - it's pretty hard to argue with the quality of life. But certainly it is a little less ""romantic"" (depending, I guess, on what you romanticize - I do like some patina and weirdness and the tall bikes that are not as common as they were) than when I first got here. In Rebecca Solnit's amazing recent book ""Unfathomable City"" (you can find a copy in the house), one of the maps featured shows insights as to where different kinds of people live in NO - my neighborhood is full of folks who ""gentrify and question gentrification"". I guess that's me. I love it, but I do miss some of the rough edges.

Anyway, all this to say - I love Bywater like my own. It IS my own. And I look forward to you becoming part of it in your own way too. Walk it, bike it, eat it, drink it. And let me know how I can help you do all that!",32,603,Entire Home/Apt,New Orleans,f,9,0,2,3,0,5,1,6,4

We encourage you to read our reviews to hear impressions and maybe get a better sense of how we're set up, location, etc.  We are also happy to answer specific questions.",6,103,Entire Home/Apt,D.C.,f,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,3,0

Professionally, I work in IT (day job) and I'm a partner in a film production company. At the moment, I'm very excited to be able to enjoy biking and hiking in the DC area!",6,63,Entire Home/Apt,D.C.,t,3,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0

We have met some very wonderful people who offer their homes for Airbnb! We like to get a 'feel' for what it is like to live in other cities and countries and Airbnb homes make that possible.

8654665,"After living all over DC (Brookland, Gold Coast, Foggy Bottom, Logan Circle), we finally decided to buy a house in a little known neighborhood called Shaw ... fast forward ten years and WOW, things have changed! In just the past three years, restaurants, bars, breweries, and music venues have been popping up along with high-end condos, newly renovated Victorian homes, playgrounds, and dog parks. Shaw has quickly become one of the most sought after DC locations for young professionals, hip retirees, and young new families. It's also the neighborhood our family calls home.  
We love to travel, Germany, France, Belgium, Thailand, the states! With our new additions to the family (two boys), our travel has been minimized, but we still find time to see our friends and family. We love hosting parties and dinners and hope that that love will translate to your stay with us!",7,146,Entire Home/Apt,D.C.,t,0,0,0,1,0,3,2,1,0
